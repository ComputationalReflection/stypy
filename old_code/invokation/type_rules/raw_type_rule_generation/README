This module is an stand-alone program consisting in old code from a previous version of stypy that has been modified
to re-enable automatic type rule generation. Generated rules are not automatically usable by stypy, because they require
manual processing to eliminate certain function return types and use type groups. However, is a very helpful tool to
 generate type rules for Python modules.


NOTE: This is not supported temporally as of version 2.2
